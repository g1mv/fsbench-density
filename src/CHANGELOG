0.10h
[+] now you can combine encoder and decoder from different libraries, i.e. miniz encoder with zlib decoder
[+] you can now select which codecs to compile

0.10d
[+] added LZFX
[+] added LZX (without decompressor)
[+] added Shrinker
[-] removed lzp1. It crashed on calgary.tar created with 7-zip 9.22. After a short analysis I decided that debugging would cost too much to be worth it.
[~] major refactoring and other improvements
[~] dynamic work scheduling. Up to now threads got roughly equally sized pieces. Sometimes one piece would take much longer than others thus skewing results in favor of codecs with more predictable performance.
[~] added QuickLZ to the list of default codecs
[~] use memcpy instead of LZ4 for warmup. It touches more memory, which is good for fairness with codecs that are weaker than LZ4.
[~] when calculating decompression speed, take into account amount of data that was really decompressed
[~] improved measurement accuracy
[!] the algorithm often considered an incompressible last block of a file to be compressible
[!] some *nix compatibility fixes

[+] added changelog
[-] removed unused LZHAM sources. I intend to readd LZHAM alpha 8, but currently there was no sense to keep it.
[-] removed LZRW*. These have only historical value.
[~] improved docs
[~] updated LZ4 to r59
