Gipfeli, a high-speed compression library.

Introduction
============

Gipfeli is a high-speed compression/decompression library
aiming at slightly higher compression ratios (around 30 %
less bytes produced for text) than other high-speed compression
libraries. On a single core of a Core i7 processor in
64-bit mode, gipfeli compresses at about 180 MB/s or more
and decompresses at about 300 MB/s, typically 5x faster than
zlib, but does not quite achieve its compression density.

Gipfeli is written in C++, with no assembler code.
